			<p>We expect sales growth will be slow to moderate, and that cash flows will be steady with annual sales projected to equal $80,000 $120,000 and $180,000 for the first three years.<p>
<p>Once the company reaches a sufficient level of profitability and accumulates a cash reserve, it plans to invest 50% of profits in research and development of new products, existing product and operational improvements, and to expand marketing and sales efforts to foreign markets. 38% of profits will be invested in low risk financial instruments. 10% of profits will be used for employee bonuses. 1% of profits will be used to support non-profit organizations that support the health. The remaining 1% will be used to support non-profit organizations that promote the health and welfare of pets in the United States. These expenses will be itemized in the later years of the business plans.</p>
